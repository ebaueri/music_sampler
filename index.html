                  Christopher Wallace, better known by his stage name The Notorious B.I.G. or his nickname Biggie Smalls, is one of the most revolutionary figures in the history of rap and hip hop. Emerging during a time when the West Coast "gangsta rap" styles of 2Pac and N.W.A. dominated rap music, Biggie took their "real" lyrics and made them less in-your-face and more smooth and pleasing. As opposed to Ice Cube's tendency to incite outrage with his voice, Biggie's distinct talking-with-a-plugged-nose, conversational style was conducive to relaxation and thought.

                  Aside from his unique voice and style, Biggie is also known for his sometimes dark, powerful lyrics. While he sometimes fits the cliche of mysoginistic and money-hungry — as almost all rappers do — his lyrics often tackle touchy subjects like suicide (Suicidal Thoughts), cancer (Things Done Changed) and murder (Who Shot Ya) wih both complexity and realism. The latter of that bunch, while familiar to most rap music, even served as a catalyst in the evolving East Coast-West Coast hip hop feud when it was viewed as a "diss track" against 2Pac, who was shot two weeks before the song's release.

                  All that being said, he does indulge in non-deep, popular tunes like "Big Poppa," "Hypnotize" and "Juicy." But nevertheless, he's consistently ranked as one of the greatest rappers of all time. People often point to not only his lyrics and style but also his natural storytelling abilities as reasons why.
